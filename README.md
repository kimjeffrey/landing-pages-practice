# [Landing Page Practice](https://landing-pages-practice.herokuapp.com/)

This site is a collection of landing pages and home pages that I copied in order to practice my HTML, CSS, and if needed, JavaScript skills. In order to practice, I only looked at the source code for things like colors, images, and fonts used for the sites. 

Through copying popular sites, I find that I'm able to learn more about the different UI/UX decisions made for these sites as well as practicing my ability to write CSS for styles I see often faster.
