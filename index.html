    <p>
      These websites were all created by looking at the different sites and copying them as close as possible 
      as I can without looking at the source code. The source code was only used to look up things like the color,
      images, and fonts used. I find that this is great practice for refining my CSS skills and also learning
      about the different UI/UX decisions made for popular websites.
